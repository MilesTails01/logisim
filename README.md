## About The Project

This repository is a collection of simple digital circuits designed in Logisim, inspired by my personal journey in building a breadboard computer. The circuits are fundamental components that mimic the behavior of integrated circuits like the 74LS08 and others, essential for anyone interested in understanding or building their own breadboard computer.

These designs are the result of my exploration and learning in the field of digital electronics and computer engineering. They are shared here to assist others who are on a similar path, looking to understand or create their own basic computer systems.

## Getting Started

To use these files, you'll need Logisim, which is a free logic simulator that allows you to design and simulate digital logic circuits. You can download Logisim [here](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/).

### Prerequisites

- Install Logisim on your computer.
- Basic understanding of digital circuits and logic gates.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/MilesTails01/logisim
```

2. Open Logisim.
3. Load the circuit files from the repository.

## Usage

Each file in this repository represents a different logic circuit that can be used as a building block for larger and more complex digital systems. You can use these circuits as they are, or modify them according to your needs for educational or project purposes.

## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open-source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.
